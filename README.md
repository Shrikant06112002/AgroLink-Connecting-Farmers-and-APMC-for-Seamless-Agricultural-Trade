# KisanSathi-The_Bridge_between_Farmer_and_APMC
This project intends to address the issue of farmers spending time travelling to market yards and selling their products, as well as some agricultural loss due to adverse weather conditions, such as crop loss, by developing a platform that will serve as a link between farmers and market yards.
